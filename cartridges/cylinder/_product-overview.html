        Anatomy of a Cylinder Cartridge
      </h2>
      <p>
        Building on Al Moen’s legacy of innovation, Moen’s cylinder cartridges are simply designed yet highly efficient in allowing smooth water flow and optimal mixture of hot and cold water. Newer cylinder cartridge models are made from corrosion-free materials for even greater longevity in general. Moen’s cylinder cartridges are built from three main parts&mdash;the cartridge sleeve, cartridge valve stem and O-rings, which are assembled into a single unit for ease of use.

        The sleeve serves as the outer shell and includes ports allowing hot and cold water to flow into the cartridge stem. O-rings surround the sleeve to seal the cartridge within the faucet. The cartridge valve stem is the moving piece inside the sleeve that is connected to the faucet handle and changes the mix between hot and cold.
