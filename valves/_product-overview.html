        Anatomy of a Valve
      </h2>
      <p>
        Every shower has a valve that acts like an engineâ€“shifting flow, regulating temperature and driving performance, and there are many options of design, functionality and operation suited to different applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        The valve is placed behind the wall and connects directly to the hot and cold water lines to regulate flow and temperature. A cartridge inserted into the valve connects to the external trim handles to control the mixture of hot and cold water and flow rate through the faucet based on the handle position.
      </p>
      <p>
