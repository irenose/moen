        Simple product design makes Duralast<span class="type_mark_18px">&reg;</span> easy to install. It slips easily and correctly into place with no guesswork, thanks to a keyed outer shell. Consistent handle feel is not affected by the torque of the cartridge nut, which cannot be over tightened.

        Bonus: All one-handle faucets with Duralast cartridges include pre-installed &#8540;‚Äù flexible supply lines.
