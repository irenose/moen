        Terminology
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are a variety of terms attached to valve function– here are quick- reference definitions of a few of the most common:
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="font-weight-med">Pressure-balancing</span> – Protects users from “shower shock” due to a sudden change in either hot- or cold-water pressure elsewhere in the plumbing system (i.e., toilet flush). Pressure Balancing valves are designed to detect the pressure drop and automatically adjust the flow of water to maintain a consistent water temperature.
      </p>
       <p>
        <span class="font-weight-med">Thermostatic </span> – These valves use a device to monitor temperature and keep the temperature consistent even as hot water levels drop in a hot water heater tank.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="font-weight-med">Cycling Valve</span> – Turns on and off in the cold position; cycles through to the hot setting based on desired temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="font-weight-med">Volume Control</span> – Maintains consistent water-flow rate as other plumbing fixtures connected to the line are in use.
